## Factorio mods by BarryKun

I made one change requested by a something awful forums member

#### build zip file

```
node build <directory>
```

#### watch a directory.

This copies the mod over to the factorio mod directory and automatically applies changes.

```
node watch <directory>
```

For Windows `%APPDATA%/.factorio/mods`

For Linux `~/.factorio/mods`

For Mac `~/Library/Application Support/factorio/mods`
